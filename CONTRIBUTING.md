# Contributing to Tinytown 🏘️

Welcome to Tinytown! Thanks for taking the time to check us out. 

🚧 This document is very much under construction. Feel free to edit or ping us on [Slack](https://tinytownhq.slack.com/archives/C013BMG6LV9) if you'd like to add content.

## Your First Code Contribution ##

1. Open [Linear](https://linear.app/tinytown/team/TIN/board) and click on the code item you’re working on. In the top right corner you should see a branch icon, click on it to copy a default branch name to your clipboard.

2. While in the *tinytown-react-app* directory, create and switch to your new branch.

> git checkout -b new-branch name

3. Stage desired file(s), commit, and push your changes.

> git add file-name 
> git commit -m “commit-message-here”
> git push origin HEAD: new-branch-name

4. On GitHub, [create a new pull request](https://yangsu.github.io/pull-request-tutorial/), and assign the appropriate reviewer.
5. On [Linear](https://linear.app/tinytown/team/TIN/board), move your task from “In Progress” to “In Review.”

## Best Practices ##

### Code Style ###
* Make explicit side-effects in arrow functions by using braces and to prevent returning of unused values:
```
someFunction()
  .then((result) => {
    console.log(result);
  });
```
or using Ramda for a more point-free syntax
```
someFunction().then(R.tap(console.log))
```

* Bias towards TouchableOpacity instead of the native Button component since the latter is not very compatible with Android.
