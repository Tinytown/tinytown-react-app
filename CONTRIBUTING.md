### Security ###

1. Whenever you must use confidential credentials (e.g., access tokens), please write these inside _.env_ in the root directory and incorporate it using **react-native-config**. Please look at _config.js_ and how MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN is incorporated for inspiration. Furthermore, for instructions on how the .env file should be written, please look at the _README<span></span>.md_ file in the root repository.

# Appendix
